# My Zettelkasten

This repository is created with the purpose of syncing my notes across multiple devices.

It also provides a nice web interface easily replicable with docker, credit to the amazing neuron project.
You can get more info about it here https://neuron.zettel.page/ and here https://github.com/srid/neuron

Feel free to contribute or apply corrections if you spot any mistake. 

The syntax used is mostly standard markdown, however some tags might be non standard (i.e. github does not recognize ==something== as highlighted, as you can probably see).
Images are inserted in static and will be only visible when actually running the webserver with neuron.

Languages: IT, EN

## A word on the note taking method

I will progressively remove part of the notes from now on (16/11/21). This decision comes from the fact that while taking pretty notes is surely satisfying, the most important part (recall questions) is what I use the most. I basically spend 80% of the time on stuff I won't go through again.

Starting from now, notes will consist of recall questions (mostly) and useful references in case they are needed, usally in the form of images/references to the material.

## Transitioning to obsidian

As of 09/04/2022, I am switching to https://obsian.md for compatibility reasons with ARM. The note format is still similar, so the syntax will be mostly identical. The only thing that needs to be changed in order to make obsian/neuron work is the path of the images (abs. in obsidian, relative in neuron). There is probably a better fix that I don't know of though.
