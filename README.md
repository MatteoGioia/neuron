# My Zettelkasten

This repository is created with the purpose of syncing my notes across multiple devices.

It also provides a nice web interface easily replicable with docker, credit to the amazing neuron project.
You can get more info about it here https://neuron.zettel.page/ and here https://github.com/srid/neuron

Feel free to contribute or apply corrections if you spot any mistake. 

The syntax used is mostly standard markdown, however some tags might be non standard (i.e. github does not recognize ==something== as highlighted, as you can probably see).
Images are inserted in static and will be only visible when actually running the webserver with neuron.
