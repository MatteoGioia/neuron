- How do we tune the parameters in GDA? What is the end result? Is it "obvious" or "intuitive"?

- How do we effectively make a decision?

- What is the main difference between GDA and logistic regression? Why the assumptions for GDA are stronger than the ones for logistic regression?

- If we were to design a spam filter, keeping track of the joint likelihood of the parameters (as per definition of a generative model) would quickly become impossible. Explain how the naive bayes model makes things easier with it's key assumption.
