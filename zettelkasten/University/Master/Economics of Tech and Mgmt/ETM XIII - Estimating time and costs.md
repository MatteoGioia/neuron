# Estimating times and costs

### Recall questions

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What are 2 possible types of estimate?</summary>

    \
	Two types of estimates:
	- ==top down (macro) ==: e.g. analogy, consensus
	- ==bottom up (micro)==: e.g. estimates of element of the WBS using acquired experience
	
</details>

2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What are the main differences between top down and bottom up estimates?</summary>

    \
	==Top down estimates are generally done by someone that has previous experience on similar projects==, but has little knowledge of the actual work required for each task (e.g. managers).
	==Bottom up estimates are instead done leveraging experience acquired from each task of the WBS==.
	
</details>

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the preferred approach for estimates?</summary>

    \
	==Combine rough top down estimates with bottom up estimates==, e.g. after top down estimates the WBS is created and bottom up estimates are developed.
	
</details>

4. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What are possible methods for top down evaluation? And for bottom up?</summary>

    \
	Top down methods:
	- ==consensus==
	- ==learning curves==
	- ==ratio methods==
	- etc..

	Bottom up methods:
	- ==template methods==
	- ==phase estimating==
	- etc...
	
	
</details>

5. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What happens when the level of detail of the WBS is inappropriate?</summary>

    \
	It is ==costly in both cases==. E.g. too much detail creates ==too much overhead==, too little could result in ==wrong estimates.==
	
	
</details>

6. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the RFC approach?</summary>

    \
	One can use ==similar projects to create an estimate of the cost/time for the current project, by plotting a distribution== and using it to ==forecast the cost== of the current project.
