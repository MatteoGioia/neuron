# Alternatives way of proving bi-similarity pt.2

Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic for an in-depth explanation of the $\square$ and $\diamond$ operators.
### Recall questions 

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Describe and explain the formulas we will use for our logic. </summary>
    
    \
    Language components: ![](../../../static/CS/form1.png)

	We can then define a ==relation between processes and our formulas==: ![](../../../static/CS/form2.png)
    
    
</details>

2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What other useful operator can we define? </summary>
    
    \
    A $\square$ operator: ![](../../../static/CS/form3.png)
    
</details>

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> How can we prove bi-similarity with these new formulas? (Theorem)</summary>
    
    \
    Refer to slides.
    
</details>

4. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the issue fo this set of formulas? Make an example. </summary>
    
    \
    This system works very ==well at proving inequalities==, but ==not as much for proving equality==: ![](../../../static/CS/form4.png)
    
</details>

5. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What happens if we remove rules from our logic formulas? What is trace equivalence? </summary>
    
    \
    We can define two new "logic". A ==negation free logic==: ![](../../../static/CS/form5.png)

	And a ==negation and conjunction free logic==: ![](../../../static/CS/form6.png) 
    
</details>

6. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> How can the set of rules be modified to work for weak bi-similarity? </summary>
    
    \
	The new set of rules is mostly unchanged: ![](../../../static/CS/form7.png)
