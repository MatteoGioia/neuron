    We want a weaker form of bi-similarity that does not discriminate against internal actions invisible to an observer (i.e. $\tau$'s in synchronisation).

	We introduce a new relation $\implies$: ![](../../../static/CS/wbi1.png)

	We can define the notion of ==weak bi-similarity==: ![](../../../static/CS/wbi2.png)

	Weak bi-similarity has the following properties: ![](../../../static/CS/wbi3.png)
