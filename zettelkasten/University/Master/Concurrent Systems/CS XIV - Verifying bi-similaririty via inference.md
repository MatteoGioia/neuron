# Alternatives way of proving bi-similarity

### Recall questions 

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Which limitations are required to prove bi-similarity with inference rules? Why?  </summary>
    
    \
    We only consider ==non-recursive processes, as deciding bi-similarity for general processes is not possible==.
    
</details>


2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What do we want to prove in order to be able to use these rules?  </summary>
    
    \
    To prove that our inference system works, we need to show that is satisfies both:
    - ==soundness==: ==whatever we infer is correct== (so bi-similar);
    - ==completeness==: ==whatever is bi-similar, it can be inferred.==
