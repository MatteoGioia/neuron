#  Linear Algebra Review

### Recall questions

Suggested reading: linalg (lect. 3)

List of concepts:
- vector space
- base & span
- linear map
- matrices (as representation of maps)
- vectors

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Are elements of a vector space necessarily lists? </summary>
    
    \
    No. For example, ==functions $f : S \to R$ with $S \neq \emptyset$ are a vector space==. \
    Remember that, ==multiplication and addition have to produce results in the domain in order to have a vector space==.

2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Are surfaces vector spaces?</summary>
    
    \
    No. ==Differential geometry studies surfaces==, however linear algebra can study ==functions on surfaces==.

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Why is y = ax + b a linear map in the case of perceptrons, but it is not if we consider it a "normal" function? </summary>
    
    \
    In the case of perceptrons, $a,b$ are the parameters and $x$ is a coefficient. In case of a function defined on $x$, the $+b$ factor makes it so the function is not a linear map.

</details>

4. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Are linear maps a vector space? </summary>
    
    \
    Yes.

</details>

5. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the link between a space and a matrix?</summary>
    
    \
    A matrix can be seen as a representation for a linear map, and it depends on the choice of bases.
