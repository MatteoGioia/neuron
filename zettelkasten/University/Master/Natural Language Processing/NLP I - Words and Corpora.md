1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is a corpus? And an utterance?  </summary>
    
    \
    A corpus is a ==computer-readable== collection of text or speech. An utterance is ==the spoken equivalent of a sentence==, complete with pauses and micro-expressions like "uh".

</details>

2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is a lemma? And a word form?  </summary>
    
    \
	A lemma is a ==set of lexical forms having the same stem and similar word sense==.
	A wordform is a ==full inflected or derived form of a word==.

</details>

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">  What is the difference between word types and word tokens? What is tokenization and why it might not be easy? </summary>
    
    \
    Word types: ==set of distinct words in a corpus==. If $V$ is the vocabulary of the corpus, then $|V|$ is the amount of word types.

	Word tokens instead is ==the collection of all the words used==.
