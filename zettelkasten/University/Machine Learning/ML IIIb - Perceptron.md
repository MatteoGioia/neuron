## Introduction to neural networks

### Neural network

Neural network is a class of ML algorithm that belongs to the category of supervised and semi supervised learning.
The learned function is continuos and linear for the perceptrons, while other advanced algorithm learn non linear functions.
Values are allowed to be real-valued so both classifiers and regressors can be trained.

### History of NN

Neural networks were born as a way to mimic the biological neural systems like the one in humans.

### The model

The network model of a single neuron is a graph with cells as nodes and synaptic connections as weighted edges from node $x_i$..

In this case, the parameters we need to tune is the weight of the edges..
