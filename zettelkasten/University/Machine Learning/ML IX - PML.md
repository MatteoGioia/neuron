# Probabilistic machine learning

This section can be integrated with FDS V - PLM

## Recall questions

- How can we rephrase ML problems to a probabilistic formulation?

- What are the 2 probablistic formulations of a ML classifier? Explain both the generative models and discriminative models.

- What is the difference between generative and discriminative models?

### Maximum likelihood estimation

- What is the main goal of modeling the problem with a generative model?

- What is the maximum likelihood estimation? Define the likelihood function and the others notions necessary to define the problem. Why likelihood is not the same as probability?

- What is statistical parameter fitting? What is a necessary requirement for the data used?

- How is the MLE principle defined?  What is a sufficient statistics?
