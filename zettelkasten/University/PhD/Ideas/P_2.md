## Text to scene generation with Humans (?)

### Title & Idea in a nutshell

Keywords: 3D scene,generation
### Abstract

We propose a pipeline for generating ...
### Main idea

Generate entire 3D scenes from a single textual prompt. Existing state of the art models produce either high quality scenes at the cost of performance:

Or introduce more efficient methods that result in a final inferior product:

Possible "attack vectors":
- improve final representation quality while improving performance (really hard, need to create a new model?)
- introduce other elements in the mix, i.e. generate scenes and populate them with humans
- ??
