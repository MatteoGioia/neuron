# Lecture 2

## Part One

### Recall questions


1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Are quantum algorithms probabilistic? How is randomness generated?  </summary>
    
    \
	    ![]()
	    Randomness is implicit to quantum computers, no need for PRGNs.

</details>


1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the state of a qbit? What is the true state?  </summary>
    
    \
	    ![](../../../static/IQC/qc1.png)
		 Note that the ==true state of a qbit cannot be observed==.

</details>


1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">  How is one able to find the content of a qbit?  </summary>
    
    \
	    ![](../../../static/IQC/qc2.png)
	    Note that ==once observed, the state of the qbit is going to be fixed to be either ..==

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">  Give a small proof of why it is hard to know alpha and beta (superposition coefficients). </summary>
    
    \
    

</details>


1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Are quantum transformations linear? What does this imply?  </summary>
    
    \
    

</details>


1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span">  Describe the Pauli matrices used in Qbit gates </summary>
    
    \
    

</details>


1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the Hadamard matrix and why is it useful? Can you think of a practical application?  </summary>
    
    \
	    ![](../)
		 This matrix allows to ==go from a classical state to a quantum state==.
		 A cool application is a ==generator of a truly random 50/50 0-1 bit==.

</details>


1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is a necessary requirement for matrices expressing transformations that preserve quantum states?   </summary>
    
    \
	    Matrices must be ==unitary== , i.e. they must preserve the original norm.

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the appropriate abstraction used to represent qbits?  </summary>
    
    \
