# Cost volume profit analysis

### Recall questions

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is Cost Volume Profit analysis? </summary>

    \
    The goal of CVP analysis is to ==study how much the final profit depends on the amount of products created==.
   

</details>


2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the contribution margin? </summary>

    \
    Contribution margin is the ==amount remaining after the variable expenses are deducted==. Note that it can also be expressed for each unit. \

</details>

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the break-even point? </summary>

    \
    It is the ==point at which the contribution margin minus fixed expenses equals to zero==.

</details>

4. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the equation for operating income? </summary>

    \
    Profit = (Prod. cost $\times$ Qty - Var. Exp $\times$ Qty) - Fixed Exp.
   
</details>

5. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Explain the components of the following CVP graph.</summary>

    \

</details>

6. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the contribution margin ratio? And the variable expenses ratio? </summary>

    \
    ==CM ratio = $\frac{CM}{Sales}$== \
    This quantity expresses how much the contribution margin changes w.r.t to sales.
    ==VE ratio = $\frac{VE}{Sales}==$ 

</details>

7. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the break-even analysis equation? What are the 2 possible ways of calculating it?</summary>

    \
    It can be found by ==equating the op. income to 0== or, alternatevely, it can be calculated as the ==ratio $\frac{Fixed Exp.}{CM ratio}$
   
</details>

8. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> How can we calculate the quantity of products necessary to get a certain profit?</summary>

    \
    Again, the equation shown before can be used. Otherwise, use the formula $\frac{Targ. Profit + Fix. Expenses}{CM per unit}$


</details>

9. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the margin of safety? </summary>

    \
    The margin of safety is equal to ==$TOT. SALES - BREAK. EVEN SALES$==. It is useful to know by which amount the sales can drop before incurring in a loss. \
    Note that ==it must be computed w.r.t. to the units to sell to break even.==

</details>

10. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the advantage of industries with a higher proportion of fixed costs? </summary>

    \
    Since the cost is fixed, the ==total gain is going to be higher when the sales are higher (w.r.t. to other industries with a lower fixed costs proportion), but also lower when sales are not as high==.
   

</details>

11. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the degree of operating leverage? What is it useful for? </summary>

    \
    Is the ==measure of how sensitive net operating income is to percentage changes in sales==. It is computed as $\frac{CM}{Net operating income}$. \
    For instance, a 10% increase in sales with a 5% deg. means a 50% increase in sales!

</details>

12. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the most effective way to structure commissions? </summary>

    \
    Instead of calculating the commissions on the sales price, it is a good idea to ==compute it w.r.t. to the contribution margin==. \
    E.g. one item might have a higher price but a lower CM than another product, but the seller would focus on the first as a way to maximise his salary.
