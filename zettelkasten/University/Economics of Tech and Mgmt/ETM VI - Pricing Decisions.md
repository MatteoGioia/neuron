- markup formula: (1+%)*price

1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What are 3 key factors that influence price? </summary>

    \
    3 key factors:
    - ==customers==
    - ==competitors==
    - ==costs==

</details>

2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the purpose of the price elasticity of demand? </summary>

    \
    It measures the ==degree to which the unit sales of a product or service are affected by a change in unit price==.

</details>

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What does it mean if a product is inelastic? And elastic? How does this influence markup?</summary>

    \
    A product is ==inelastic if a change in price has little effect on the nr. of units sold==. Elastic is the opposite. \
    Because of this, the ==markup on the product should be as high as possible in the first case, lower in the latter==.

</details>

4. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> How do we determine the the price ceiling and price floor for a product ? </summary>

    \
    The ==price ceiling is determined by customers and competitors==, the ==price floor by incremental cost==.
  
</details>

5. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the three step process to determine the price? </summary>

    \
    Process:
    1. compute unit product cost
    2. determine ==markup percentage on absorption cost==
    3. compute final price

</details>

6. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the cost base if we use the cost-plus pricing approach? </summary>

    \
    It's the ==absorption costing unit product cost==. It basically includes all the direct/indirect material/labour costs. 
  
</details>

7. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the equation to compute markup? </summary>

    \
    Markup eq. = $\frac{ROI \times Investment + SA \ exp.}{un. \ sales \times un. \ product \ cost}$

</details>

8. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Why is customer latitude an important concept? What does it prevent? </summary>

    \
    Customer latitude ==helps to take into account the fact that customers might not buy the product if the cost increases, or markup is too high==. The issue with the plus pricing approach is in fact that it is strongly related to the nr. of units sold, so if the predictions is wrong and we can't sell enough units we will incur in a loss even if the price is higher.

</details>

9. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is value based pricing? </summary>

    \
    Value based pricing takes into account ==the economic value to the customer== to compute the final price. In fact, price (EVC) is computed as the ==price of the best alternative (reference) + the value that differentiates our product from the alternative (differential)==.
