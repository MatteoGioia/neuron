1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Define the 6 steps of a good decision process.</summary>

    \
    Steps:
    1. ==Define the alternatives==
    2. ==Identify relevant costs and benefits== and ignore the irrelevant costs and benefits
    3. ==Differential analysis== of the ==future costs and benefits of the alternatives== (see question 2)
    4. Identify irrelevant ==(sunk) costs==
    5. ==Ignore the benefits/costs common== to both alternatives
    6. Consider ==opportunity cost==, a.k.a. the potential benefit given up when an alternative is chosen over another

2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What are differential cost, differential revenue? And incremental and avoidable cost? </summary>
    
    \
    ==Differential cost==: cost between alternatives \
    ==Differential revenue==: difference between future revenues of the alternatives \
    ==Incremental cost==: increase in cost between the 2 alternatives \
    ==Avoidable cost==: cost that can be eliminated choosing an alternative over another
    
</details>

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Why is the differential approach used more than the total cost approach? </summary>
    
    \
    Most of the time ==there is not enough info to prepare detailed income statement==. It also paints a ==clear picture of what the relevant costs== really are.

4. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is a make or buy decision? </summary>
    
    \
    A company involved in more than one activity in the value chain is vertically integrated. A ==decision to carry out one of the activities in the value chain internally, rather than to buy externally== from a supplier is called a “make or buy” decision.

</details>

5. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is a special order? What costs/benefits should be considered in this case </summary>
    
    \
    A special order is a ==one time order==, not part of the company's normal business. \
    When analyzing a special order, ==only the incremental costs and benefits are relevant==.

</details>

6. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is a volume trade-off decision? What is a constraint? </summary>
    
    \
    When a ==ompany has not enough capacity to produce all the products, they must sacrifice (part of) the production== of some of them. \
    ==Constraint: limited resource== that restricts company ability: e.g. bottleneck caused by a certain machine.

</details>

7. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Is it always a good idea to shift production on the product with the highest contribution margin? </summary>
    
    \
    Yes, but ==w.r.t. to the constrained resource==!
