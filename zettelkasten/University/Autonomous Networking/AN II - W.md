### Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

In a wireless sensor wireless network
- devices are smaller, less powerful (low datarate)
- devices can sense the environment
- devices can be many more than in other networks

Applications of WSN:
- industrial control
- environmental monitoring
- healthcare
- smart houses

### Structural health monitoring

SHM allows to detect deteriorations nad potential damages of structure over the time:
- during or immediately after che construction
- ..

### Roles of devices in a WSN

Sensors: collect data and send them to a sink

Sink: registers sensor's data

Actuators/Actors: can control devices based on sensor's data

### WSN deployment

Deployment:
- random: often an uniform distribution of nodes is assumed
- regular: planned, often a geometric shape

Mobile sensor nodes√ß

### Characteristics of a WSN

Scalability:

Wide range of densisties

Limited resources for each device

Mostly static topology
