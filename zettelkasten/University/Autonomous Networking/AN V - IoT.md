## Iot basics

### Internet of Things

The term is used to refer to..

### Smart objects 

A smart object is...

A smart object must be:
1. identifiable
2. able to communicate
3. able to interact

What makes them different from a simple network device is the ability to sense..

### IoT from different points of view

### Required features for IoT devices

## Battery free IoT

### Smart objects with no battery

IoT with battery free devices is achieved through the use of backscattering. There exist low power devices
that are able to use radio frequencies to power themselves.

The backscattering used in this case is ambient backscattering: the signal emitted by other devices in the environment
is exploited to draw power and to operate.

### Characteristics of ambient backscattering

### Sensor augmented RFID tags

Can also use sensors
