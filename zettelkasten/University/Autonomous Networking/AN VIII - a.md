## Intro to RL 

We already addressed a complicated use case of WSN: a smart home where each device can transmit and be queried for information.
In the following, we are going to assume

We want to query devices...

To do so, we are going to use reinforcement learning.

### Good sequences of decisions

Learning...

To learn how the environment works, the agent can be "simply" put into the real world.

### Characteristics and methods of RL

### More on online learning

When we deal with RL, there is no predetermined best behaviour.

### Reward and optimization problem

Reward hyp: maxisiming the cumulative reward

### Exploration-exploitation dilemma

## A general RL framework

Agent - Observation

### History and state

Private vs agents' 

In fact, if the ... partially observable

Our job is to

## Components of RL agent

### Policies

### Value function

### Environment model
