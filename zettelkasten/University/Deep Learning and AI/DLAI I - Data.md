# Data, features and more

### Recall questions

1. <details>
    <summary>What is prior knowledge?  </summary>
    Prior knowledge describes what we already know about the data (e.g. probability distribution).
    <br> We are interested in studying prior-based data.
</details>

2. <details>
    <summary>What do we assume when examining our data? </summary>
    We assume our data has an underlying structure.
    <br> This allows us to discover a map from input to output.
</details>

3. <details>
    <summary> What is the cusre of dimensionality? Use the 1mpx image example to justify the answer.</summary>
    We need an exponential number of observations w.r.t. to the dimensions we have to discover a pattern. 

    For example, $n^1$ for 1-d, $n^d$ for $d$ dimensions.
    <br> Think of the space of 1mpx images: the space that describes all such images is very sparse, and we would need millions of images to find a pattern between them!
</details>

4. <details>
    <summary>Why can we say instances are the result of a synthesis process?</summary>
    INSERT FORMULA
    Note that sigma acts non linearly most of the time.
</details>
 
EX. Question: assuming the distr. is uniform, the 2 points are going to be orthogonal (they will have nothing in common).

5. <details>
    <summary> What is the "proper" name of the output of the function sigma? Is it unique?</summary>
    ..
    <br> Each data points admits many possible embeddings..
</details>

6. <details>
    <summary> What are latent features?</summary>
    Latent features are features not necessarily localized in space, and not necessarily evident in the embedding space.
</details>

7. <details>
    <summary> What is the manifold hypotesis? </summary>
    In deep learning, it is assumed that ..
</details>

8. <details>
    <summary> Why do we say that feature choice is task driven? </summary>
    Specific problem require different features.
</details>

9. <details>
    <summary> Give (one of) the definition(s) of deep learning.  </summary>
    Task driven pardigm to extract patterns and latent features from given observations.
