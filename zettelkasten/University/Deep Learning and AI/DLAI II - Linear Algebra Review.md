1. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Are elements of a vector space necessarily lists? </summary>
    
    \
    No. For example, ==functions $f : S \to R$ with $S \neq \emptyset$ are a vector space==. \
    Remember that, ==as long as multiplication and addition produce results in the domain, we have a vector space==.

2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Why is y = ax + b a linear map in the case of perceptrons, but it is not if we consider it a "normal" function? </summary>
    
    \
    In the case of perceptrons, $a,b$ are the parameters and $x$ is a coefficient. In case of a function defined on $x$, the $+b$ factor makes it so the function is not a linear map.

3. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> What is the link between a space and a matrix?</summary>
    
    \
    A matrix encodes how basis vectors are mapped, and this is enough to map all other vectors in their span since ...
