2. <details markdown=1><summary markdown="span"> Which universal priors are we referring to? What do they mean?</summary>
    
    \
    Universal priors:
    - structural priors (structure of the data)
    - self similiarity
    - translation invariance (invariance w.r.t to the position in the image)
