## A word on the note taking method

I will progressively remove part of the notes from now on (16/11/21). This decision comes from the fact that while taking pretty notes is surely satisfying, the most important part (recall questions) is what I use the most. I basically spend 80% of the time on stuff I won't go through again.

Starting from now, notes will consist of recall questions (mostly) and useful references in case they are needed, usally in the form of images/references to the material.
